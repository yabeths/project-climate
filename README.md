# Project

## Overview

The project is to construct a database for a sample organization
working on climate action. The process of developing the database
will follow the model presented in class: you will suggest requirements
on the basis of an initial interview; then you create a data model
that will go on to become the structure of the database. You will
write SQL to create, populate, update, and report on the database
to address the customer's needs.
