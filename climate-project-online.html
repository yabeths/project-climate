<h1 id="online-version-differences">Online Version Differences</h1>
<p>This project was originally developed as a collaborative exercise,
with teams doing a whole project, using class time as a meeting space
for people to split up work responsibilities.</p>
<p>This form of collaboration requires meetings at least three times a
week, and that simply isn’t compatible with the scheduling flexibility
students depend on in an online course.</p>
<p>In the adapted format, I provide roughly the amount setup work that
might be done by other members of a team. For writing queries, I let you
choose those that you are best prepared to write or are most interested
in, which is very much like a project “signup” in some Agile processes.
You will be working in Git, and sharing your work by committing and
pushing it to a common repository. I expect your work to be
self-contained and to work in my copy of the repository just as it does
in yours. These mechanics are similar to what they would be on a
team.</p>
<p>As you go through this online adaptation, I encourage you to think
about how you would have come up with anything I provide: you or someone
like you would be expected to create these artifacts when building a
product from the beginning.</p>
<p>The good part about a group project is that no one should be
overwhelmed by the work: someone will be there to support you. I will
perform that role. Let me know how you’re doing!</p>
<p>Something I like about this adapted format for the project is that
everyone has the chance to see the richness of SQL: instead of one
member grabbing the hardest or easiest or most-fun, you can all see
those parts. I think this can be a very good experience.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>The goal of the project is to let you experience how all the
technologies and techniques you have practiced in this class–from
requirements gathering to answering questions with SQL–fit together.</p>
<p>This is an introduction that covers a lot of material. I hope that as
you go over it, each step will feel familiar. At the same time, I hope
this gives you new perspectives and raises new questions as you connect
the pieces from the course.</p>
<p>I am here to answer any of these questions. Send an email or arrange
a Zoom. The online format makes it hard for me to know what areas you
are confident about and what areas I have not explained in a way that
resonates for you. A short email or a Zoom can help us quickly bridge
this online gap, and I hope would be rewarding for both of us.</p>
<p>Let me help.</p>
<h1 id="project-mechanics">Project Mechanics</h1>
<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<p>Throughout this project, you will be working in a single GitHub
repository. Your work will build on earlier commits.</p>
<p>I will create a repository specifically for you, and invite you to
collaborate on it. This means we can both push to the same branch, which
is how members often work within a team. I think it is fine if you stick
with the “main” branch, but I can work with other branches if you let
know how you want me to use them.</p>
<h2 id="codespace-and-postgresql">Codespace and PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>The repository will be DevContainer/Codespaces enabled, so it will
configure a PostgreSQL database server for the project to work with.
This will start when you start your Codespace.</p>
<p>The database will start empty; it is your responsibility to update
the SQL/scripting so it populates successfully from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-files">Supporting Files</h2>
<p>I will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>reset.sh (to drop and recreate the database)</li>
<li>a script to run both the SQL to create tables and to populate tables
(create.sh)</li>
<li>some SQL for creating and populating the database so it matches the
sample data</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have to modify or add to these to create a running sample of
the database for the customer to evaluate.</p>
<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>The assignments are provided in Canvas. They start with some design
questions, then move into implementation.</p>
<p>For each assignment, you should commit and push/sync your code in
GitHub, then indicate you are complete in Canvas.</p>
<h2 id="artifacts">Artifacts</h2>
<p>Remember that you are building code (mostly SQL) that a customer
would try out to evaluate your prototype, and that would be used in the
future to work with the database after it has grown to have much more
data. The queries are not questions that need an answer today, but tools
that will provide an answer today and again in the future.</p>
<p>I will evaluate your code <em>in my own Codespace</em>. I can see
only what you have published, and evaluate only what happens when I run
your scripts. The Codespaces environment makes it much easier to bundle
your work and show it to someone else, so you should not have challenges
with this, but I may ask you to look into any issues that show up when
your code is run in a different Codespace.</p>
<h3 id="sync">Sync</h3>
<p>I will be looking at our shared repository on GitHub. Your Codespace
creates a clone of that respository–the one we share is the remote
“origin” in the Codespace.</p>
<p>You must “Sync” in VSCode (or “git push” at the Terminal) to copy
your work up to the shared repository.</p>
<p>If you want to confirm what we can both see, visit the GitHub
repository. (This is the page that you start the Codespace from.) That
page should show the synched versions of files and the log message from
your latest commit.</p>
<h2 id="notes-and-special-care">Notes and Special Care</h2>
<p>Some areas of this scenario require special care:</p>
<ul>
<li>people appear in lots of reports–since these are often the same
people, normalize (or look for a single source of truth)</li>
<li>a Sale has a many-to-many relationship with Merchandise (one order
can be for more than one item, and different customers may order
Merchandise at different times on different orders)</li>
<li>be careful that the “Quantity” attribute is attached to the
appropriate entity</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="project">Project</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The project is to construct a database for a sample organization
working on climate action. The process of developing the database will
follow the model presented in class: you will suggest requirements on
the basis of an initial interview; then you create a data model that
will go on to become the structure of the database. You will write SQL
to create, populate, update, and report on the database to address the
customer’s needs.</p>
<h2 id="artifacts-1">Artifacts</h2>
<p>I will invite you to collaborate on a shared repository.</p>
<p>This repository will be the Single Source of Truth for your project.
Git keeps a history of your commits, so I encourage you to commit
anything you think is interesting (so it is logged). Git’s history
includes deleted files, so feel free to delete any files or parts of
files that are distracting or that you don’t want to show as your final
product.</p>
<p>Here are the artifacts I will be asking for in the project. The order
follows the Analysis/Design/Implementation methodology. You should
commit all artifacts to your repository and sync with the origin on
GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-statement">Requirements Statement</h3>
<p>A Statement of Scope is not required. If you write one, I will
provide feedback on it. If you want to try seeing how a generative AI
produces a Statement of Scope, you are welcome to experiment with that,
too. If you use generative AI, watch that the AI does not try to commit
you to features or standards that the customer did not ask for. (These
features would probably raise their costs without providing value.)</p>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>You will adapt the design in a couple of places. The project includes
a Diagrams.net diagram of the sample documents (without normalization,
relations, etc.).</p>
<p>If you use the design tools to help with your table additions, please
add/commit your design files so they can be part of your project
documentation!</p>
<h3 id="sql">SQL</h3>
<p>The project will require several batches of SQL; each will have a
different responsibility and will be needed at different stages of the
database’s lifetime. The project framework includes these files; you
should adapt them as necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL statements to complete the table structure from an empty
database</li>
<li>SQL to populate the database with the sample data</li>
<li>queries to answer questions the organization is interested in</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<h3 id="analysis-and-design">Analysis and Design</h3>
<p>During Analysis and Design, you will be working with the sample data
(in .html) and the ERD (in .drawio) format. The DevContainer includes
the hediet.vscode-drawio in your Codespace so you can work with .drawio
files directly. However, VSCode may not be the best tool for this work:
for the ERD you may want more screen space than the Codespace
window.</p>
<p>The Codespace treats .html as source; the samples may be easier to
read in preview or in a browser directly.</p>
<p>You can download both the .html and .drawio files from the GitHub
repository viewer (<em>not</em> the Codespace) to your local machine and
work with them there.</p>
<p>Or–even better: clone the repository locally and work in the cloned
directory. You can use VSCode or the Git command line to sync.</p>
<h3 id="sql-1">SQL</h3>
<p>Use the Codespace and the web-based VSCode when writing SQL: it has
the PostgreSQL installed and set up, and SQLTools configured to work
with it. I will use this Codespace configuration to test your code.</p>
